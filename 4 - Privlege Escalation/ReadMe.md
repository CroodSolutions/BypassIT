So far we have not found any native Privilege Escalation (PE) techniques that are specific to AutoIT or AHK.  PE techniques seem to be highly parishable as they come out often and then are quickly remediated.  At any given time, multiple are available, but like most of my jokes, they do not age well.  As such, my suggestion for red/purple teamers wanting to use AutoIT or AHK for PE testing, is to take the exploit code for the latest successful priv esc exploits and port them over to AutoIT/AHK and then you can deliver them as a part of this framework.  If you come up with something cool, please do a pull request or even fork the project, so it helps others.
