# How To Use
To start the listener server/GUI, use the command
`python3 bypassit.py --cli --web`
The `bypassit-agent.au3` file will need to be updated to use the correct server IP variable in the beginning of the script.
Once updated, the AutoIT interpreter may be used to launch the agent script, or it can be compiled into an executable.
