# Imphash Research Tool
This Python script is designed to scan executable files within a specified directory and compute their import hashes (imphashes). The imphash serves as a unique identifier for the set of imported functions in an executable, making it valuable in malware analysis and detection. It processes all identified PE (Portable Executable) format files, computes their imphashes, and reports the most common ones.

## Purpose
- Scan a specified directory for executable files.
- Identify PE files and extract their import hash values.
- Compute and report the most common import hashes from these files.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `pefile`: A Python library for parsing and analyzing PE files, installable via pip (`pip install pefile`).

# YARA Rule Analysis Tool
This script helps in assessing which YARA rules are most effective by processing the results of multiple YARA scans conducted across various targets. It identifies the frequency with which each rule is triggered and provides a summary of the total unique rules encountered during the scan.

## Purpose
- Process files containing the output from multiple YARA scans.
- Determine which YARA rules are most frequently triggered.
- Report on the statistics related to the frequency and uniqueness of these rules.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries: `sys` for command line argument processing, and `collections` for efficient handling of rule hit counts.

# AutoIT Malware Analysis Tool
This script is designed to analyze AutoIT scripts suspected of being used for malware purposes by examining their content for potential malicious indicators such as suspicious functions or behaviors found in known malware samples written in AutoIT.

## Purpose
- Analyze the content of a given AutoIT script file to extract patterns indicative of potential malware.
- Provide recommendations on how to handle or mitigate identified threats based on analysis results.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- External libraries: `requests` for downloading samples (if applicable, depending on implementation details), and standard libraries such as `os`, `argparse`, and `re` for various string operations and pattern matching necessary for the analysis process.
